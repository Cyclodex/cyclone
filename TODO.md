#Cyclone TODO

## Less
Create improved LESS file from the CSS Code we have.

## Load libraries not over cdns
All the angular and other libraries are now loaded over cdn's.
Lets change this and see if we can do this with webpack / bower or whatever.

 * Fixed for index.html and the main app
 * NOT YET FIXED on authentication.html!

## Time entries improvement
Don't show 0h xmin  -> lets move this into a other function (not on template) and don't show zero value.

## Check type of project
Update the type of project after the user has set a project name.
 * check current entries
 * later lets make this somehow configurable as a default for a project
