# Cyclone

Simple online timelog tool.

## Description

Cyclone allows you to track your tasks during a day and keep a good overview of it.

You wonder, **what you did during a day**... Maybe you also need to keep **tracking time** into a company software or issue tracker and *switch tasks/projects multiple times*, **Cyclone** helps you to manage this.

With Cyclone you can

* **Track** your daily work as entries in a timeline
* **Tracked** entries can be marked as "done". (eg. when booked into an other tool)
* **Grouping** entries as tasks
* **Work/Private** separate your entries from work and private time. (like lunch & breaks)
* **Archive** allows you to go back, and verify what you tracked in the past.
* **Calendar (new)** Gives you a rough overview of projects you worked and if there are any missing entries you forgot to check as "done".

**Access** is done with authentication:

* simple email/password account
* google account

## Demo

Ask me for access the tool: [cyclone@jumps.ch](cyclone@jumps.ch).
Limited access, because I use the free google service with limited accounts.
