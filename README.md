# Cyclone

Simple web time log tool.

## Description

Cyclone allows you to track your tasks during a day and keep a good overview of it.

* **Track** your daily work as entries in a timeline
* **Tracked** entries can be marked as "done". (eg. when booked into an other tool)
* **Grouping** entries as tasks
* **Work/Private** separate your entries from work and private time. (like breaks)
* **Summary** A timebar will show you what and when you have worked on
* **Project** summaries are also available
* **Archive** allows you to go back, and verify what you tracked in the past.

**Access** is done with authentication:

* simple email/password account
* google account

Limited access, because I use the free google service with limited accounts.
